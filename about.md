Hello and welcome to Linda Data's GitHub page. We are a data service company where we specialize in data cleaning, data entry, data analysis, visualization, and data science. My name is Sergio Mora and along with my wife Maria Gomez, we founded this company in 2022. We have both worked with data in one way or another for over a decade both in our full-time careers and with side projects. We decided to start Linda Data as a way of pooling our resources together and providing a better and more comprehensive experience for our clients.
